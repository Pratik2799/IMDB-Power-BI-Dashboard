# IMDB-Power-BI-Dashboard
In this dashboard, I analyze IMDb movies by year, genre, total revenue, bottom-ranked movies, revenue by director and movie, total votes, and votes by genre.
The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into the performance of movies on IMDb, and to identify trends and patterns that can inform decision-making in the film industry.
